LMAlertView
===========

`LMAlertView` aims to be an end-to-end, customisable clone of `UIAlertView` for iOS 7. Identical frost/gaussian blur effect, colours, CALayer animations.

I rushed this together in a few days so it isn't quite perfect, but almost there!

Spot the difference!

## Installation

Use the awesome CocoaPods to add `LMAlertView` to your project:

    pod 'LMAlertView', :git => 'https://github.com/lmcd/LMAlertView.git'

## Usage

    // Property temporarily required - fix on the way
    self.alertView = [[LMAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Test"
                                                        message:@"Message here"
                                                       delegate:nil
                                              cancelButtonTitle:@"Done"
                                              otherButtonTitles:nil];
                                           
    // Add your subviews here to customise
    UIView *contentView = self.alertView.contentView;
    
    [self.alertView show];

## Known Issues

- `LMAlertView` isn't being added to the view hierarchy, or retained anywhere else, so the view is released by the time the cancel button is pressed, causing the app to crash (the target for the button is in the view class). As a temporary fix, please assign any 'LMAlertView' objects to properties, or find another way of retaining them until they're dismissed.
